## Overview 
** This portfolio was last updated on 03/13/2022 to showcase new projects. The portfolio also features an updated resume and LinkedIn profile. 

I created an updated version of my Portfolio in order to showcase my projects, homework assignments, and other work. I added a "resume" to the nav which leads to an external link of my resume. I also added my github and linkedin profiles, as well as updated my education/experience section to feature more recent roles. 

I also updated my GitHub account to include pinned repositories of my best work. I updated my resume to include the languages and skills I am learning in this class and updated my linked in with links to my GitHub and portfolio. 

## Summary of My Task & User Story
